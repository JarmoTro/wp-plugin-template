# WordPress Plugin Template

Base template for an object-oriented WordPress plugin.

Making WordPress plugins often, I got tired of writing the bases for them, which were almost always nearly identical, so I made this template to help speed up the process.

While I try to follow best practices, this is what works best for me. Feel free to fork the repository and modify it to suit your own preferences.
