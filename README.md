# WordPress Plugin Template

Base template for an object-oriented WordPress plugin.

If you write WordPress plugins often, you might find yourself writing nearly identical code each time. I made this template to help speed up the process.

While I try to follow best practices, this is what works best for me. Feel free to fork the repository and modify it to suit your own preferences.
